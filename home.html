    <p class="move">Hello Kitty has been a part of our society for centuries in pop culture. We have seen Hello Kitty in films, games, and Funko pops which makes her popular in the economic part of society. In the symbol aspect, Hello Kitty is a symbol of Kawaii, which catches either a young girl's attention or someone interested in that type of style. In her background history, some of the reasons why they made Hello Kitty was to inspire kids to be like her as a teaching method to be friendly to other little kids. It would also be something that kids would grow up with and talk about with their friends of all ages! This would also be an idea not to judge others based on their appearance since Hello Kitty shows an example of that when Hello Kitty was a girl instead of a cat. This amazed most of the world since it was something they never expected. Hello Kitty also became a style for fashion or somewhat related to that. We see her on brand companies because they see how the fandom is grown. If you have learned from something here today go spread it to the world!</p>
